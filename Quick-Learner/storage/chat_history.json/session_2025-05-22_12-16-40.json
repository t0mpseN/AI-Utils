      "content": "Okay, sure! Here's a simple Python script that calculates the area of a rectangular prism given its dimensions:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_area_prism(base, height):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the area of a rectangular prism.\n\n  Args:\n    base: The length of the base of the prism.\n    height: The height of the prism.\n\n  Returns:\n    The area of the prism.\n  \"\"\"\n  area = base * height\n  return area\n\n# Example usage:\nbase = 5\nheight = 10\narea = calculate_area_prism(base, height)\nprint(f\"The area of the prism is: {area}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`def calculate_area_prism(base, height):`**: This line defines a function named `calculate_area_prism` that takes two arguments: `base` and `height`.\n2.  **`\"\"\"Calculates the area of a rectangular prism. ... Returns: The area of the prism.\"\"\"`**: This is a docstring – a multiline string that explains what the function does, its arguments, and its return value.\n3.  **`area = base * height`**:  This line calculates the area of the prism by multiplying the `base` by the `height`.\n4.  **`return area`**: This line returns the calculated `area` value.\n5.  **`base = 5`  and `height = 10`**:  These lines set the values of the `base` and `height` variables to 5 and 10, respectively.\n6.  **`area = calculate_area_prism(base, height)`**: This line calls the `calculate_area_prism` function with the `base` and `height` values and assigns the returned value to the `area` variable.\n7.  **`print(f\"The area of the prism is: {area}\")`**: This line prints the calculated area to the console. The `f` before the string indicates an f-string, which allows you to embed variables directly into the string.\n\nTo run this script:\n\n1.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `area_prism.py`).\n2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.\n3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n4.  Run the script using the command: `python area_prism.py`\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\nThe area of the prism is: 50\n```\n\nWould you like me to create a different example, perhaps one that does something more complex, or one that demonstrates a specific programming concept?",
